# Simon-Says-App
The app will consist of the memory game known as Simon Says. The app meant to be like a fun
puzzle game for users to test their memory. The goal is to test the ability of the user to memorize
patterns in short periods of time. Consists of the classic implementation of simon Says where there are four
buttons that will flash in a sequence that increases after each round on the screen and the player needs to correctly match 
the sequence to move onto the next round. If a sequence is incorrectly inputted then it ends and you will be taken to see your
score.

The app includes several screens that the player can navigate to which can be seen below.
